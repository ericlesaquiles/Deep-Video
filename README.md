# Welcome to Neural Video

This repository comprises a series of notebooks meant to deal with
image processing for videos - more specifically *deep* image
processing (doing action classification, movements segmentation,
etc.), usually with neural networks.

The first notebook is out, it has a small introduction (not an
overview).

I intend to add more notebooks in the future, and to expand (and
better explain) past ones as well.
